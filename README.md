https://mubzie.github.io/weather_app_v2/

## Project Summary
This project exercise is part of The Odin Project (TOP) Advanced JavaScript course. The task was to implement a weather app that shows weather information. This project demonstrates using Webpack for code bundling and working with API. There is also a heavy emphasis on clean code and proper documentation.

## In Action
### Project Preview

## Future Update
- No plan for future update. 

## Goal
- To gain an understanding of working with an API with vanilla javaScript
- Knowledge of Webpack for code bundling

## Reflection
My experience with working with an API started from this project and it was such a fun realization of how the world is connected through this piece of software. I worked with the in-built Nodejs fetch API for the networking connection and used the JavaScript async/await to handle the response and error. I was able to solidify my knowledge about working with an API after the completion of this project.
